          Using CAPI framework made cli commands at Arista Jsonify. This code
          got merged in to Arista EOS(Switch operating system). User's can now
          get access to output of cli commands via API also.

          <strong>Eggress Queue Counter Bug</strong>:<br />
          Queues on switch port gets set to zero when switch restarts, currently
          queues get's build by algorithm which takes like 10 minutes to get
          rebuild, due to which applicaiton's dependent on this got affected. By
          compilation of various values from the database i rebuilt the value
          and added it to the port which helped to fix the counters in few
          minutes.
